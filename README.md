# Human

What if your phone was a tool purpose built to help you be a better human? Not a well of infinite
distraction, but a focused experience to help you get more out of life with less time and attention.

This isn't a whole phone OS, but it's the start to something better. Something we can build together.
Something for people, by people.

Let's be human.
