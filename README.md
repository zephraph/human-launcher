# Human

What if your phone was a tool purpose built to help you be a better human? Not a well of infinite
distraction, but a focused experience to help you get more out of life with less time and attention.

This project won't solve all our problems, but it's a start. A start to something better. Something
we can build together. Something for people, by people.

Let's be human.
